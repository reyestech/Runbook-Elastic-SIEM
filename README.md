# üõ°Ô∏è **Elastic SIEM Runbook** 
### Hector M. Reyes | SOC Analyst  
### TL;DR
- Deployed and configured the **Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, Beats)** in a virtualized lab.  
- Ingested and correlated logs from **Windows, Linux, and attack simulations** (Kali, BeEF, PowerShell).  
- Visualized detections and validated **real-time alerts** in Kibana.  
- Documented **SOC workflows, blue-team detections, and automation processes**.

---

## üß© **Description & Blue Team Implementation**  
Following a simulated company-wide breach, I developed an **Elastic SIEM Lab** to replicate enterprise-level monitoring and detection workflows.  
This environment enables centralized log collection, attack simulation, and threat correlation ‚Äî providing a realistic platform to train, test, and optimize blue-team operations.

The **Elastic SIEM** acts as the analytical core for defenders, continuously ingesting endpoint, network, and system data to identify anomalies, automate correlation, and generate actionable alerts.  
By simulating attacker activity through Kali Linux and BeEF, and collecting event data from Windows and Linux endpoints, this lab demonstrates how a modern SOC leverages Elastic to maintain real-time visibility and resilience.

**Objectives:**  
- Centralize and normalize event logs from multiple operating systems.  
- Detect and correlate malicious behaviors across environments.  
- Validate SIEM effectiveness through controlled attack simulations.  
- Build reusable detection pipelines and SOC playbooks for rapid response.

## üéØ **Overview**  
The **Elastic Stack (SIEM)** integrates data ingestion, analysis, and visualization to provide a unified threat detection platform.  
It transforms raw logs into contextual intelligence, enabling analysts to detect, investigate, and respond efficiently.

**Key Capabilities:**  
- **Early Threat Detection:** Identifies suspicious behaviors through rule-based and behavioral analytics.  
- **Correlated Insights:** Connects related events for deeper investigation.  
- **Custom Rules & Alerts:** Tailors detections to specific network conditions.  
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Ensures 24/7 visibility across distributed assets.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Pre-Setup ‚Äî System Preparation & Kali Linux Readiness**
Prepare all VMs before installing Elastic Stack. This step updates systems, sets hostnames, installs essentials, and configures Kali for attacker simulation so you can validate detection pipelines end-to-end.

### **Objective**
Get the Elastic SIEM server and Kali attacker VM ready:
- Patch and baseline Linux hosts.  
- Set clear hostnames for log correlation.  
- Install offensive tools on Kali for realistic telemetry.  
- Verify network connectivity between lab hosts.

### **System Update & Baseline** (Ubuntu / Debian hosts)
Update, upgrade, and install required packages on the Elastic/Kibana/Logstash nodes:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade
sudo apt -y install curl jq apt-transport-https gnupg lsb-release net-tools
```

Set a clear hostname for each VM (helps correlate host logs in Kibana):
```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname elastic-lab
# example: sudo hostnamectl set-hostname kibana-node
```
> üí°**Tip:** Use short, descriptive hostnames like `elastic-lab`, `kibana-node`, `win-endpoint`, `kali-attack01`.

### **Kali Linux Preparation** (Attacker VM)
Kali will act as the Red Team node to generate recon/exploit traffic for SIEM validation.
Update the system and remove unused packages:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt -y full-upgrade
sudo apt autoremove -y
```

Install core offensive & network tools used for testing:
```bash
sudo apt -y install nmap metasploit-framework beef-xss curl netcat-traditional hping3
```
> These tools create realistic logs: network scans, web exploitation, SSH brute-force, HTTP payloads, and more.

#### **Diagnostics & Testing** (what to generate from Kali)
Use Kali to simulate attacker behavior and validate detection:
- Reconnaissance: nmap, hping3, HTTP probes.
- Exploitation: `msfconsole` (Metasploit), `beef-xss` for browser attacks.
- Lateral movement / command execution patterns via `netcat`, `ssh` tests.
- Generate Windows events with PowerShell on Windows VMs to validate endpoint coverage.

Ensure events flow through your pipeline:
`Beats` ‚Üí `Logstash` ‚Üí `Elasticsearch` ‚Üí `Kibana`
This confirms ingestion, parsing, correlation, and alerting are functioning.

## **Network Verification**
Confirm connectivity between core lab hosts:
If you use firewalls, ensure ports are open (ex: 9200 for Elasticsearch, 5601 for Kibana, Beats ports as needed).

Checklist (pass/fail before install)
- [ ] All VMs patched & updated 
- [ ] Hostnames set and documented
- [ ] Kali has required tools installed
- [ ] Basic network connectivity verified
- [ ] Plan for test scenarios documented (recon, exploit, logs to generate)
